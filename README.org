* What this will be?
A TUI mpd frontend similiar to ncmpcpp. Name is a subject to change as I have no idea how to call it right now.
** Why?
Because I want to practice writing Rust code and add some functionality that my current main frontend of choice (ncmpcpp) lacks at least in my opinion.
* Application structure
** Interaction methods:
- "Graphical"
  Main tui window, something like ncmpc/ncmpcpp
- Commands
  Something like ncmpcpp/vim commands
- Terminal arguments
  For quick database updates and scripting (something like mpc).
